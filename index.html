        <h2>What is Pranayama ?
        </h2>
        <p> Pranayama is an ancient breath technique that originates from yogic practices in India. It involves controlling your breath in different styles and lengths. Ancient yogis used it for relaxation, mental focus and healing. 
        Prana translates into “life force energy,” and Yama translates into “control or mastery of.” Thus, pranayama is a breathing technique used to control, cultivate, and modify the amount, quality, flow, and direction of vital energy in the body. 
        </p>
        <h2>How Pranayama effects on your minds anf your body</h2>
        <h2>How to practice Pranayamar Technicks</h2>
        <p>For most pranayama techniques, the breath is slow and steady, breathed in and out of the nose and down into the belly. Always sit with a straight spine and a relaxed body. While you are practicing Pranayama, let go of any thoughts by focusing on your internal breathing. Breath in, Breath out.

            The first thing to master and pranayama is the exhalation, which should be slow and longer than inhalation. 
            Gently inhale and exhale. 
            Let the eyes be soft and closed during your practice.
