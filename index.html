        <h1>Breathing technics and its Benefits</h1>
        We can survive without breathing for less than a few minutes.
       
        It is the only one part of our body's autonomic nervous system that can be consciously controlled. And through conscious breathing, we can influence and balance all of the others. <br> <b>If somebody taught you how to use it ?</b> 


        <h2>What is Pranayama ?</h2>
        <p>
          Pranayama is an ancient breath technique that originates from yogic
          practices in India. It involves controlling your breath in different
          styles and lengths. Ancient yogis used it for relaxation, mental focus
          and healing. Prana translates into “life force energy,” and Yama
          translates into “control or mastery of.” Thus, pranayama is a
          breathing technique used to control, cultivate, and modify the amount,
          quality, flow, and direction of vital energy in the body.
        </p>
        <h2>How Pranayama effects on your minds and your body</h2>
        Breathing exercises balance the nervous system. <br> Optimal Oxygen level in your bloodstream keeps your cells healthy and improve your blood pressure, increase your energy levels and relax your body. 

        <h2>How to practice Pranayama Technicks</h2>
        <p>
          For most pranayama techniques, the breath is slow and steady, breathed
          in and out of the nose and down into the belly. Always sit with a
          straight spine and a relaxed body. While you are practicing Pranayama,
          let go of any thoughts by focusing on your internal breathing. Breath
          in, Breath out. The first thing to master with pranayama is the
          exhalation, which should be slower and longer than inhalation. Gently
          inhale and exhale. Let the eyes be soft and close them during your
          practice. <br>
          <b>The breath is your invisible anchor when the outside world seems overwhelming.</b>  Observe your calm breath and sensations.
